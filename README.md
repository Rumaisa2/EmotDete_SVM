# EmotDete_SVM

Overall, the Emotion Classifier App is a useful tool for tracking and analysing emotions, with room for growth and advancement.
This project looks to be a web application for Emotion Classifiers created with the Streamlit framework and machine learning methods. The project is described as follows:

Emotion Detection App is a web-based application created to analyse and categorise emotions in text input. Project Name: Emotion Detection App. It has the following essential attributes:

Users can enter text in a text box on the home page.
The software determines the emotion connected to the text once it is submitted. The anticipated emotion is shown along with a confidence score, an emoji icon, and a representation of the feeling.

The likelihood of each emotion category is displayed using an Altair visualisation of prediction probabilities.

Track user interactions and application metrics with the help of the monitor page.
Page Metrics: Indicates which pages were accessed and how frequently.
Emotion Classifier Metrics: Displays a log of user inputs, including the timestamps, raw text, and predicted emotions together with their probabilities.Â Visualizations: Shows bar charts and pie charts to show the number of page visits and the number of emotions predicted.

The "About Page" provides information about the application, its function, and any other information you would like to make available to users.
used technologies
The main framework for creating the user interface and interactivity of a web application is called Streamlit.
The database system that is used to store and retrieve information about page visits and emotion classifier metrics is called SQLite.
The backend of the application, which includes text processing, machine learning, and data analysis, is programmed in Python.

Natural language processing (NLP) is likely the foundation of the machine learning model used to predict emotions from text inputs.
Prediction probabilities and other parameters are presented visually using the data visualisation tools Altair and Plotly.
Joblib: Used to load a machine learning model that has already been trained.

How It Operates:

Text sent into the input field on the Home page is how users communicate with the Emotion Detection App. In order to anticipate the emotion related to the input, the programme then analyses the text using a machine learning model. Results of the prediction are shown, along with the expected mood, an emoji representation, and a confidence level. Users can also look through the metrics and visualisations on the Monitor page to obtain information about user interactions and predicted emotions.

Cases of Use

Sentiment Analysis: Text data can be subjected to an analysis of sentiment or emotion that allows users to better comprehend customer reviews, social media sentiment, and other aspects of text data.
Monitoring and analytics: Users can keep tabs on how the application is used and learn more about the emotions being analysed by visiting the Monitor page.
Future Developments

You might think about including more features or improvements in your project, like:
For tracking user-specific interactions, user identification is required.
improving the machine learning model's classification of emotions.
adding the capacity to discern emotions from lengthy texts.
exporting information for later examination.
Overall, your Emotion detection App is a useful instrument for tracking and analysing emotions, with room for growth and advancement.
